# Homework for session 2:
#   1. DEFINE a new function called quadratic_equation:
#       as a reminder, in math it's defined as f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
#       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation
#       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula
#
#   2. your function will need to take variables a, b, c
#
#   3. it must solve for x
#
#   4. you will need to know how to calculate powers (i.e. 2^2 = 4): 
#       - https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html?highlight=sqrt#math.pow
#
#   5. you will need to know how to calculate a square root (i.e. sqrt(4) = 2)
#       - https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html?highlight=sqrt#math.sqrt
#
#   6. feel free to print() to show your work
#
#   7. it must return an answer x as OUTPUT


def quadratic_equation(a, b, c, x):
    # DO YOUR WORK HERE
    x = None

    print("the answer is " + x)
    return x


# test cases:
quadratic_equation(1, -2, 1)
quadratic_equation(5, -3, 2)
# add more as necessary
